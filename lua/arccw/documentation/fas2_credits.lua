--- who even read this ---




GSO is garbage lmao
its mediocre at best and you cant convince me otherwise
adding nothing new compare to cs+ aside from -owo slight model change- with basically the same stat modifier for every-bloody-thing 
even fucking less customizability in general


Thats why I decide to utilize arccw to the fullest and push it to a level "not seen" before
With the aim of
1. The sheer amount of unique attachments (both fictional and realistic)
2. Freedom of choice (its a fucking game lmao not everything have to be bounded by reality, I really hope people would just fuck off and just accept that this is a fucking game and not some sort of simulator)
3. Bored lol 
4. 4th point
5. how 2 blender 2.9

--- to the 5 people that decompiled this mod for whatever reason and read this
--- please dont fucking make cheaty attachment or anything like that
--- thank you very much
