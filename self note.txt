change mk18 grip path
THE FUCKING M249 BELT































gso is not that good
doesnt have much to differ even the large variety 


about handguard and stuff
all of them should have ironsight change
all of them MUST have a some sort handguard/slide change be it longer or shorter or completely different and not just barrel length


[sniper] (both mag and shell fed)
handguard / barrel:
-sd varient (cosmetic)
-obrez/no barrel 

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa this shit is really hard to do 
this along with mg and shotgun will contain very little customization

only the m249 gives something to work with
------------------------------

[shotgun] 
handguard / mag tube:
-sd varient (cosmetic)
