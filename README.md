"Top text, bottom text"

21 Weapons, 249 Attachments. It's a lot of stuff 

The most* customisable weapon pack on the workshop with ludicrous amount of *fictional* customisations 

-Overview-

Development starts shortly after the disappointment that is Gunsmith Offensive

Featuring nearly every weapon from Firearms Source 2 (and some custom one) packed to the brim with kitbashed attachments

Words and previews alone cannot describe how much shit is in this so give it a go

*The main focus of this mod is not realism so don't complain about that*.

-Credits-

Fesiug - qci, icons and a lot more
