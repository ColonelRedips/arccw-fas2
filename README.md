20 Weapons, 227 Attachments. It's a lot of stuff 

The most customisable weapon pack on the workshop with ludicrous amount of *fictional* customisations 

-Overview-

Development starts shortly after the disappointment that is Gunsmith Offensive

Featuring nearly every weapon from Firearms Source 2 (and some custom one) packed to the brim with kitbashed attachments

If GSO is Bootleg Modern Warfare. This is Bootleg Cold War but better

Barrels, handguard, stocks, mag conversions, everything you expect and unexpect, handcrafted for each and every firearms.

Unlike the stubborn cunt who made GSO. This features full on ~~slightly wonky~~ AKIMBO system for all pistols* and SMGs.

*The main focus of this mod is not realism so don't complain about that*.
