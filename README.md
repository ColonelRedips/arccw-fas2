"Top text, bottom text"

19 Weapons, 218 Attachments. It's a lot of stuff 

The most customisable weapon pack on the workshop with ludicrous amount of fictional customisations for your heart's content

-Overview-

Development starts shortly after the disappointment (to me) that is Gunsmith Offensive

Featuring nearly every weapon from Firearms Source 2 (and some custom one) packed with kitbashed attachments

If GSO is Bootleg Modern Warfare. [Insert name] is Bootleg Cold War

Barrels, handguard, stocks, mag conversions, everything you expect, handcrafted for each and every firearms.

Unlike the stubborn cunt who made GSO. This features full on ~~slightly wonky~~ AKIMBO system for all pistols* and SMGs.

*The main focus of this mod is not realism so don't complain about that*.
